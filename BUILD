# note: This is not an ideal solution; it violates single-source-of-truth
#       because targets and their flags must be duplicated here. Additionally,
#       it requires the developer to specifically run this bazel target in order
#       to update. These problems could be solved if this was a service
#       subscribed to bazel build events.

    # automatically picked up. If you don't need flags, a list of targets is
    # also okay, as is a single target string. Wildcard patterns, like //... for
    # everything, *are* allowed here, just like a build. As are additional
    # targets (+) and subtractions (-), like in bazel query
