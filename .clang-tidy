# Configure clang-tidy for this project.

# Here is an explanation for why some of the checks are disabled:
#
#
#  -bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters: too many false positives.
#
#  -bugprone-unchecked-optional-access: too many false positives in tests.
#     Despite what the documentation says, this warning appears after
#     `ASSERT_TRUE(variable)` or `ASSERT_TRUE(variable.has_value())`.
#
#  -misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: getters and setters are stupid
#      and don't solve the root issue. Bad design is bad design--this check
#      won't solve that.
#
#  -modernize-use-trailing-return-type: clang-tidy recommends using
#      `auto Foo() -> std::string { return ...; }`, we think the code is less
#      readable in this form.
#
#  --modernize-concat-nested-namespaces: clang-tidy recommends
#      `namespace google::cloud {}` over `namespace google { namespace cloud { } }`
#      We need to support C++14, which does not supported nested namespaces.
#
#  --modernize-use-nodiscard: clang-tidy recommends adding a nodiscard annotation
#      to functions where the return value should not be ignored.
#      We need to support C++14, which does not supported the annotation.
#
#  -modernize-return-braced-init-list: We think removing typenames and using
#      only braced-init can hurt readability.
#
#  -modernize-avoid-c-arrays: We only use C arrays when they seem to be the
#      right tool for the job, such as `char foo[] = "hello"`. In these cases,
#      avoiding C arrays often makes the code less readable, and std::array is
#      not a drop-in replacement because it doesn't deduce the size.
#
#  -performance-move-const-arg: This warning requires the developer to
#      know/care more about the implementation details of types/functions than
#      should be necessary. For example, `A a; F(std::move(a));` will trigger a
#      warning IFF `A` is a trivial type (and therefore the move is
#      meaningless). It would also warn if `F` accepts by `const&`, which is
#      another detail that the caller need not care about.
#
#  -performance-avoid-endl: we would like to turn this on, but there are too
#      many legitimate uses in our samples.
#
#  -readability-magic-numbers: this is a good principle, but there are times
#      (like test fixtures) when a magic number makes sense and this check is
#      annoying
